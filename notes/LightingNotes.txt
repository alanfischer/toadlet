Fairly simple, but if lighting does not appear to be working, make sure that the mesh isn't getting run through
the vertexLighing program, since that disables future lighting on that mesh.

Mascot defaults to full bright for lit models if no light is in scene.

JSR184 defaults to dark for lit models if no light is in scene.
