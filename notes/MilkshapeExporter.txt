I need to re-examine the milkshape .xanm exporter.  As of January 18th, 2007, the rake-setter does not export correctly.

If I export an .xanm of rake-setter-throw1, and then re-import, its hosed.

If I export an .xanm of rake-setter-throw2, and then add it to a .xmsh and play it, its hosed (extra set on the end).






(04:08:52 PM) Bus: the only thing wrong is the toadlet importer
(04:08:59 PM) Bus: it cuts the total frames down to 30
(04:09:03 PM) isanythingnotakn: hmmm
(04:09:07 PM) Bus: all 40 frames were still there in the ms3d model
(04:09:34 PM) Bus: becuase there were keyframes beyond the 30'th frame
(04:09:45 PM) Bus: so even if you set the model to have only 30, milkshape remembers the rest
(04:09:55 PM) Bus: and when I exported, i got the full 40
(04:10:08 PM) isanythingnotakn: oooh
(04:10:10 PM) isanythingnotakn: interesting
(04:10:22 PM) isanythingnotakn: so somethings hosed on the toadlet importer?
(04:10:59 PM) Bus: well, the animation length in the exported .xanms is 1.33
(04:11:14 PM) Bus: and the importer appears to cut off anything beyond 1
(04:11:22 PM) isanythingnotakn: ok
(04:11:32 PM) Bus: out of this whole mess, that is the only problem
