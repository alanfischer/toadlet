Sprites in Mascot Capsule can have 2 scale modes:

POINT_SPRITE_LOCAL_SIZE
POINT_SPRITE_PIXEL_SIZE

In theory we should be able to just use LOCAL_SIZE and have mascot sprite
projections work the same as software & c++ sprites.

However, LOCAL_SIZE seems to have problems when paired with PARALLEL_PROJECTION.
That or the scales are not yet understood properly.

So we currently use PIXEL_SIZE, and set the sprite to be the same size as the
frameWidth & frameHeight, so mascot sprites should act the same as JSR sprites.
