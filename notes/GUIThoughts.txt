Look more into letting the nodes be used for 2D widget layouts.
Originally we had the Sizeable interface for this, but it was removed
in favor of eventually letting us set the LocalBound as a AABox, then
the layout of a LabelNode or possibly size of a SpriteNode would be
determined by the LocalBound, if it was externally set.
