The current Mascot projection calculations, of:

px=stuff(rx)*mLastAspect;
py=stuff(ry);

Reproduce JSR184 projections.

If we wanted it to do the default Mascot FOV projection, it would be:
px=stuff(rx)*mLastAspect;
py=stuff(rx)*viewportAspect;

A problem appears on sprint hardware however, the setProjection(near,far,width,height), does not work
so we only allow fovX projections, and use arctan to get the correct FOV to feed
