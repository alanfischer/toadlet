*** The Toadlet Engine cmake folder ***

The Modules and Platforms folders contain CMake scripts for
library detection and cross compilation.

Since some of these scripts are based on existing CMake scripts, 
the CMake license file has been included here as LICENSE.txt
to ensure compliance.

The Dependencies folder contains helper CMakeLists.txt files for
glew and mxml, in case they need to be built for your platform and
you are having trouble setting up the proper build options.
