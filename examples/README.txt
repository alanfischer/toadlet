*** The Toadlet Engine examples folder ***

The examples folder contains small programs that
demonstrate features of the toadlet engine and that 
can be used to test a proper install of toadlet.

The example types are subdivided by toadlet module.
Each can be built using CMake scripts or platform
specific build files found in their respective 
subfolders.
