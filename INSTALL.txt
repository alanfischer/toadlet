1. Dependencies
    The following packages (libraries
and headers) are optional dependecies
of the various toadlet libraries.
    Missing them will result in a build
of toadlet that does not possess 
certain capabilities.
    Note that the Android build only 
requires a functional jdk and an 
up-to-date android-sdk.

toadlet_egg:
* libpng
* libjpeg
* libgif
* zlib

toadlet-peeper:
* OpenGL
* Direct3D 9 (Windows only)
* DirectX 10 (Windows only)

toadlet-ribbit:
* OpenAL
* Ogg Vorbis
* Audiere (Windows only)

toadlet-tadpole:
* Freetype
* MiniXML

toadlet-pad:
* X11 (posix only)


2. Setup
    Toadlet uses CMake to greatly
simplify the task of building it for
the large number of supported platforms.
If you are unfamiliar with CMake, better
read up on it first: http://www.cmake.org

    We recommend using out of source
builds with Toadlet. Simply create a
subdirectory within the toadlet project
(eg build.win when building for Windows)
and enter that directory. You should
create separate build subdirectories
for each platform specific build of
toadlet. (eg build.wince or build.osx).

    Also, toadlet supports some additional
options, such as fixed point math,
TOADLET_FIXED_POINT, that you might want
to use in your build directory naming, eg:
build.wince.fixed

    On Windows platforms, cmake needs
to be aware of your Visual Studio
installation to create project files.
Typically, it is best to open up a 
Visual Studio console to enter the
cmake commands that follow. (eg. Start->
Programs->Visual Studio->Tools->Console 
or something similar.)
    

3. Build commands

3.1 General
    The minimum arguments to CMake for 
toadlet are (where .. is the location of 
the base of the toadlet project):

   cmake ..

    This will build and install toadlet into
the default install locations. We STRONGLY
recommend specifiying your header and library
installation path via the following:

   cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=path/to/wherever ..

This way you can place different platform builds of
toadlet into different locations. 

    Sometimes the toadlet dependices will be 
installed into non-standard paths which cmake 
does not autmatically find. (This is typical on
Windows platforms).  You can instruct cmake to 
seach additional directories for the dependencies
with the following:

   cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=additional/directories/to/search ..

You can specify multiple paths my separating them with a 
colon : between each one on windows systems and a ; on posix systems.

    Finally, on certain systems (like posix) cmake requires 
you to determine the type of build (debug/release/etc) when
calling cmake. You can set this up by calling:

   cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=BuildType ..

Where BuildType can be either Debug or Release.


3.2 Windows
    On windows systems, toadlet usually needs to be told where to
find the dependencies. Otherwise the setup is straightforward:

   cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=%HOME%\toadlet\win32 -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="C:\Program Files" ..

Note: RTTI May be enabled or disabled with -DTOADLET_RTTI=ON or OFF
   
 
3.3 WinCE
    Toadlet also builds for WinCE using cmake toolchain files. 
In addition, you have to do a 2 step process since cmake cannot 
yet change the platform build type in Visual Studio 8 and up. 

    First you call a cmake build normally with the toolchain file and 
the special UPDATE_WINCE variable off. Then you call cmake again 
with UPDATE_WINCE on. Ignore the complaints it makes, you're 
ready to go. Otherwise the WinCE build is similar to the win32 build:
   
   cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=..\cmake\Toolchains\WindowsCE.cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=%HOME%\toadlet\wince -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\SmartDevices\SDK\PocketPC2003" -DTOADLET_FIXED_POINT=ON -DUPDATE_WINCE=OFF ..

   cmake -DUPDATE_WINCE=ON ..


3.4 Posix
    On posix systems don't forget to set the build type, if you 
are using makefiles. A typical command might look like:

   cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/toadlet/posix -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..


3.5 OSX
    Toadlet for OSX is easy to build using Xcode Projects. You only
need to make sure you tell cmake to use the Xcode generator with
the -G switch as follows:

   cmake -GXcode -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/toadlet/osx  ..

   If you wish to build a universal binary, you may specify additional
architectures as such:

   cmake -GXcode -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES="i386;ppc" -GDCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/toadlet/osx ..

   Valid options for architectures are: i386, ppc, x86_64, ppc64

3.5.1 OSX Dependencies
   To build GLEW as a universal binary, you must edit glew/config/Makefile.darwin
Change the CC and LD lines as follows:

   CC = cc -arch i386 -arch ppc
   LD = cc -arch i386 -arch ppc

   To build MiniXML as a universal binary, run it's configure script as follows:

   CFLAGS="-arch i386 -arch ppc" LDFLAGS="-arch i386 -arch ppc" ./configure --prefix=$HOME/mxml

   The same valid architectures are as above 

3.6 iPhoneOS
    Toadlet is avaialble for the iPhoneOS platform using 
Toolchain files. Note that dependency checking will find
the system osx libraries if the iPhone SDK ones are not 
found. Make sure you setup your CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH to avoid this. 

    Much like with WinCE, cmake's generated Xcode build will be for
the wrong platform. You need to manually update. First call cmake 
with the toolchain file and the special UPDATE_IPHONE variable off. 
Then you call cmake again with UPDATE_IPHONE on.

   cmake -GXcode -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmake/Toolchains/iPhoneOS.cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/iPhoneOS -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$HOME/toadlet/iphone/deps -DTOADLET_FIXED_POINT=ON -DUPDATE_IPHONE=OFF ..

   cmake -DUPDATE_IPHONE=ON ..

NOTE: Be sure you set your xcodeproject to use the same iPhoneOS SDK that cmake found!


3.7 Android
    When building for android, you need to specify the 
android.jar for the android sdk you wish to build against, 
using ANDROID_JAR. 

   cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/toadlet/android -DTOADLET_PLATFORM_ANDROID=ON -DANDROID_JAR=$HOME/android/android.jar -DTOADLET_FIXED_POINT=ON ..
	
    On Windows systems, the Visual Studio generators for
cmake java tend to be annoying to use, since Visual 
Studio wants to edit the already preprocessed java files 
instead of the original source files. 

    Instead, use the nmake generators an run command line 
builds, and a separate editor for the .java sources. It is
so much nicer to use.

   cmake -G"NMake Makefiles" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/toadlet/android -DTOADLET_PLATFORM_ANDROID=ON -DANDROID_JAR=$HOME/android/android.jar -DTOADLET_FIXED_POINT=ON ..


4. Doxygen
    Toadlet source files can be documented in HTML using 
Doxygen. To build the docs go into the doxygen/ subfolder
and type: "doxygen Doxyfile"

    To view the results point your webbrowser at:
doxygen/html/index.html

Note: You'll need the Doxygen tool installed, and
we recommend the Graphviz package for the dot graph
generator.
