 *** The Toadlet Engine Tools README ***

See the INSTALL.txt file for instructions
on building the toadlet tools for your 
target platform.

The toadlet tools are mainly used to work
with the tmsh and xmsh files that toadlet
uses for its 3D model format. 

Importers and Exporters for some modelling 
programs are included here as well.
