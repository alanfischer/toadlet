1. Dependencies
	The following dependencies are required to build the toadlet tools

* A build of toadlet
* The Milkshape3D SDK (Windows only, if you wish to build the mesh importer & exporter)


2. Setup

	If you wish to build the Milkshape3D plugins, you should have copied
the msLib directory to your Milkshape directory. (Do not just copy the contents of
the folder, make sure the msLib folder is still in your Milkshape directory)

	If you are doing an out of out of source build again, make your directory in tools like:

	toadlet/tools/build.win32.float
	
	And then issue the cmake command below.
	
	If you are doing an in source build, then just be in the tools directory, and issue
a similar command to below, but without the trailing ..

	
3. Build commands
	Similar to build toadlet, to build the tools, you issue:

	cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=path/to/toadlet_install ..
	
	This will build and install the tools, or on windows, create the tool project files.
