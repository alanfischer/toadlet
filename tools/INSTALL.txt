1. Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to build the toadlet tools

* A build of toadlet
* The Milkshape3D SDK (Windows only, if you wish to build the mesh importer & exporter)
* Blender 3D and access to it's scripts/ folder


2. Setup

Make sure you know where your build of toadlet is installed to. You will need to set it in 
the CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH argument below if toadlet is not in a system location.

If you wish to build the Milkshape3D plugins, you should have copied
the msLib directory to your Milkshape directory. (Do not just copy the contents of
the folder, make sure the msLib folder is still in your Milkshape directory)


3. Build commands

Create a build folder in this directory, say build/

Enter the build/ folder and call cmake: cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=path/to/toadlet_install ..

Open the visual studio project, xcode project, or run the makefiles to build the toadlet tools.
